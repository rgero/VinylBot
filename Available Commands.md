### Top
There are three flavors of this one
- `!top {user}` - Returns the top artists by album count. If there is no user, then it is for the household. If there is a user, then it's for that user.
- `!top plays {user|artist}` - Returns the top albums by play count.
  - If there is no user or artist, it returns the top played albums of the household
  - If there is a user, it returns the top albums played for that user
  - If there is an artist - it returns the top albums played for that artist.
- `!top locations` - Returns the locations sorted by album count. Just to see if which stores sold us the most albums.
  - This will have a user variant in the future.
